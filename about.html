            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Marcelino Luis Alaniz, a Houston native and currently an undergraduate at Rice University pursuing a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Operations Research. My academic work and extracurricular projects focus on embedded systems, robotics, and real-time computing. I've led robotics teams, contributed to lunar rover development, and engineered autonomous vehicles, earning hands-on experience with power systems, microcontrollers, and real-time algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professionally, I've interned at NASA, working on mechanical systems and advanced robotics, and at Harris County Engineering, optimizing traffic signals and conducting field studies to improve public safety and traffic efficiency. I'm passionate about developing creative solutions for complex technical problems, driven by a combination of technical rigor and real-world application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond engineering, I enjoy supporting educational initiatives as a Technology Teaching Assistant, and I'm always engaged in collaborative projects that bridge software, hardware, and data-driven insights.
            </p>
