            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Pasadena, Texas where I was a part of the marching band and the robotics club. I was also a member of the MIT MITES community, which helped me get to where I am today.</p>
            
            <p>Now, I am a student at Rice University (not far from home), studying electrical engineering with a strong interest in embedded systems and power systems. I have experience in various engineering projects and internships, including working with NASA and personal projects like this website.</p>
