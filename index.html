    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="marc.jpg" alt="Marcelino Alaniz" class="profile-pic">
    <p>Hello! I'm Marcelino Alaniz, an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Rice University in Houston with a passion for technology and innovation. I'm set to graduate in May 2026 with my B.S. EE. Prior to my time at Rice, I completed my Associate of Art in General Studies at San Jacinto College in Pasadena with a perfect 4.0 GPA. In my free time, I enjoy lifting weights and checking out different coffee shops near me (maybe I will make a page about that on this site). Feel free to reach out and learn more about me.</p>
