            <p>Hello! I'm Marcelino Alaniz, an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Rice University in Houston specializing in Computer Engineering. I'm set to graduate in May 2026 with my B.S. EE, and I am primarily interested in transmission and embedded systems. Prior to my time at Rice, I completed my Associate of Art in General Studies at San Jacinto College in Pasadena with a perfect 4.0 GPA. In my free time, I enjoy lifting weights and checking out different coffee shops near me (maybe I will make a page about that on this site). Feel free to reach out with any questions or advice!</p>
